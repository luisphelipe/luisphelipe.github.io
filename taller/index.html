      Hey, my name is Luis Pereira, I'm a junior backend dev from Curitiba - PR. I was searching for remote friendly
      companies and Taller immediately got my attention. I have worked with <strong>GraphQL</strong> API development
      using <strong><a href="https://github.com/luisphelipe/todo">Ruby on Rails</a></strong>,
      and recently I've focused on improving my <strong><a
          href="https://github.com/luisphelipe?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=react">React</a></strong> skills. I also know
      <strong>Laravel</strong> and
      have a <a href="https://github.com/luisphelipe/agenda">project</a> to show it. I've
      seen
      that you guys use Drupal, right? I would like to learn it. If I needed to sell myself, I would talk about my will
      to
      get really good at programming, and my love for learning and deliberate practice the difficult stuff. I'm also
      very
      introverted, which makes remote work a dream for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I've read lots of blog posts about taller culture, and decided to get in touch since I identify myself as
      a
      match for <strong>Taller values</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I especially liked the post about <a
        href="https://blog.taller.net.br/como-aumentar-a-resiliencia-do-seu-time-parte-1/">team resilience</a>. I've
      read part of Antifragile before, and i really liked the concept of
      designing an environment that welcomes and benefits from difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also liked the one about <a href="https://blog.taller.net.br/feedback-em-rotulos/">feedback</a>. I've thought
      before about the difficulties of
      communication, and the post reminded me that the other person doesn't see what I see. It's important to minimize
      the
      ambiguity of speech and when necessary inquiry about what is being
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to hear back from you so we can chat about it.
