      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Fullstack web developer from Curitiba - PR.

      <h2>Tech</h2>
      <p>
        I primarily know <a href="#projects">Rails</a>, and I have some practice
        with <a href="#projects">Laravel</a>. I have done API development
        following REST and GraphQL, and I also follow TDD
        <i>- when I'm not in a hurry</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-1">
        Lately all I've been doing is practice JS, and I just discovered how fun
        the MERN stack can be... I've learned React, Express and Mongo, and I'm
        planning to focus on this stack from now on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: All my apps are hosted at Netlify and Heroku,
        <i>since it's free</i>. Also for this reason, the first API request may
        take up to 10 seconds to respond, since Heroku as to <i>wake up</i> the
        server.

          Kanban board for my personal usage. I just started this, and I plan to
          keep improving it. For now it uses localStorage, but I want to
          implement <i>Projects</i>, where multiple people could collaborate
          <i>just like your everyday kanban tool</i>

          This was a weekend project, It's supposed to help you find recipes
          with the ingredients at your disposal. I learned more about Mongodb
          and I also developed a Python scraper to <i>steal</i> recipes.

          Yet another Todo-list app, this iteration was to practice Express and
          Mongo. I also wanted to focus more on the design this time, It was fun
          and made me proud.

          Yeah, it's a web agenda, it's purpose is to schedule appointments. I
          used Laravel, Bootstrap and some custom CSS to make it the way that I
          wanted. It is responsive <i>like all my projects since then</i>.

          Interactive Conway's game of life. I wanted to code this on the
          browser for a long time, React finally made it possible. In this

          HTML+CSS as graphics
